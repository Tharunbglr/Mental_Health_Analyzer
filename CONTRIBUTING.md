Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mental Health Analyzer.

Guidelines
- Use feature branches named `feature/your-topic` or `fix/issue-123`.
- Run tests and linters locally before opening a PR.
- Keep changes small and focused; include tests for new behavior.

Testing
- Create and activate a virtual environment, install deps, and run `pytest`.

Code style
- The project uses `black`, `ruff`, and `isort`. Run these tools before committing.

Security & data
- Do not commit secrets (API keys, private data). Use environment variables or secrets in CI.
- Any change that affects data handling or privacy must include a short note in the PR describing the change.

Thanks â€” maintainers
